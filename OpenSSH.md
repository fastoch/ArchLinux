# What is OpenSSH?

- It's a remote management tool that gives you access to run commands on another machine.
- It was developed by the OpenBSD project
- It's the closest thing to a standard that we Linux people have when it comes to remote access
- It's a suite of utilities (multiple binaries), the most important of which are the server and client components
- By default, openSSH uses port 22
