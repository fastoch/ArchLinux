# Two basic modes: normal and insert 

- **Normal mode** provides efficient ways to navigate and manipulate text.
- In **insert mode**, you write text as if in normal text editor.
- To change between modes, press **Esc** for normal mode and **i** for insert mode.

# Navigation

## Word movement (w,e,b)

To navigate the text in terms of words, you can use **w**, **e**, and **b**.
- w moves to the start of the next word
- e moves to the end of the word
- b moves to the beginning of the word

## Number powered movement

Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys; you can combine movement keys with a number.  
For example, 3w is the same as pressing w three times.
