# Using Ansible to automate your endpoints configuration

When I get a brand new computer and want to set it up, I just open up the terminal and run this cmd:
- `curl deploy/bootstrap | sudo bash`

This is the only cmd that I have to run to set up a new computer.

## What exactly is this cmd doing?

- The `curl` cmd allows you to fetch something from a URL
- `deploy` is actually the hostname of a Web **server** on my LAN
- that server is serving one **file** named `bootstrap` via Apache
- this `bootstrap` file is a simple **bash script**
- `curl` is going to fetch that `bootstrap` file from the `deploy` server...
- ...and we pipe this file into `sudo bash` in order to run the script it contains
