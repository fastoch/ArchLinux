In computing, a **shell** is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs.

In Linux, any program that you run has 3 important components:
- standard input (StdIn), represented by 0
- standard output (StdOut), represented by 1
- standard error (StdErr), represented by 2

Standard input provides some input to the program. For example, a command that you might type in the terminal.  
The output is usually the result that you get when you hit Enter after typing a command.  
Standard error logs any error that is generated when the system is not able to run a command.  

We can use various redirection techniques to manipulate how these components are handled.  
For example, we can make a command input its results into a file instead of printing them on screen.
