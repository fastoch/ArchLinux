# What is Linux?

- At the origin of **Unix** systems was a project called **Multics**. It was abandoned because of its complexity.
- Unix was initially named **Unics**, which stands for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, a simplified version of Multics
- Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson developed Unix using a programming language called **C** (created by Dennis Ritchie)
- Linux is a clone of Unix that was created by **Linus Torvalds in 1991**
- Linux is the **kernel** that powers a Linux operating system.
- Kernels are programs that talk directly to the hardware and manage resources and processes
- Kernels need a whole operating system to be useful
- When a Linux kernel is bundled with operating system software and they get shipped together, we call it a Linux **distribution**

# Main Linux distributions (distros)

- Red Hat family (Fedora, CentOS)
- Debian family (Ubuntu, MX Linux, Linux Mint)
- Source Code distributions (Slackware, Gentoo, Arch Linux)
