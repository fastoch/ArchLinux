# What is Linux?

- Linux is the kernel that powers a Linux operating system.
- Kernels are programs that talk directly to the hardware and manage resources and processes
- Kernels need a whole operating system to be useful
- When a Linux kernel is bundled with operating system software, that is called a Linux distribution

# Linux distributions (distros)

- Red Hat family (Fedora, CentOS)
- Debian family (Ubuntu, MX Linux, Linux Mint)
- Source Code distributions (Slackware, Gentoo, Arch Linux)

Once the kernel starts up, how do you start up everything else?  
The very first process that runs after the kernel boots up is one of those:
- system V (five) init (came out of the old UNIX world)
- systemD (was created because there were a couple of issues with system V init)
